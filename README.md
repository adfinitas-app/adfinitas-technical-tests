# adfinitas-technical-tests
The technical tests to join Adfinitas

## Before starting

Don't be afraid if you don't have the time nor the knowledge to finish all tests. Go as far as you can. Try at least to cover a little bit all languages.

Important note: don't fork from GitHub, create a **private** repository from this one and share access to `scorsini@adfinitas.fr`.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at `scorsini@adfinitas.fr`.

When we give you that repository, we will tell you what skills to tests from that list:

 - [Backend](backend/README.md) : `Go`
